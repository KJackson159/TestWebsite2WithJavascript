    <h1>A Test Website</h1>
    <p>
      The purpose of this simple website is just to test out how<br />
      to use GitHub Pages, and it's to start trying out CI/CD.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, only HTML and CSS is used, so only CD is being used<br />
      since the simple website is static. This will be updated later in<br />
      a separate folder to include javascript before implementing CI with CD.
